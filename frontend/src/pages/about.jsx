        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Travel Emission Estimation:</strong> Estimate carbon emissions from flights, cars, and motorbikes. Our car and flight calculations use the Carbon Interface API, ensuring high accuracy. Bike emissions are calculated manually based on reliable data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Household Emission Calculations:</strong> Calculate emissions from various household activities, including electricity, LPG, and coal usage, helping users track and manage their overall carbon footprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Dashboard:</strong> Visualize your emissions over time and across different activities. The dashboard provides insights into your carbon footprint, helping you identify areas for improvement.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our application uses advanced APIs and reliable data sources to provide accurate emission estimates:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Carbon Interface API:</strong> For car and flight emission calculations, we use the Carbon Interface API, which provides up-to-date and precise emission factors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manual Calculations:</strong> For motorbikes, we use industry-standard emission factors. Small, medium, and large motorbikes have specific CO2 emission rates per kilometer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Household Emissions:</strong> Emission factors for electricity, LPG, and coal are based on standard data, ensuring comprehensive coverage of common household emission sources.
          </li>
        </ul>
